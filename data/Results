The reliable monitoring of respiratory rate (RR) is very important for the treatment and management of COPD. Based on inkjet printing technology, we have developed a stretchable and wearable sensor that can accurately measure RR on normal subjects.

However, other studies reported the opposite trend.

Furthermore, expression of individual VE genes were not correlated between paired nasal and bronchial samples from the same patients.

Because of the measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus (e.g. stay at home as much as possible), personalized digital health interventions may be particularly suitable to reach smokers at home.</p>,time: 26.9593s
